# Dependency-Injection-Preso

These are the slides and code samples for my preso "Dependency Injection: Why Is It Awesome and Why Should I Care?".

The slides were created with Reveal.js. All of the assets for creating the slides are in here, but you can ignore all of that.

Things of note:

1. The PDF file in the root of this project. That's an export of the slide deck (for some reason Reveal.js likes to add
blank pages to the export. Sorry about that -- all the content should be there though).

2. All the code demos are in the /WireBoxDemos folder.  There is a copy of WireBox inclued in there as well. 
Everything should run as-is on any current CFML server.  (I use CommandBox to keep things simple.)

Enjoy!
